## Issues

1. 3pl will redirect the site to your nearby postal
2. As it's good for user , it's actually trouble for tester as user tends to view the info on that particular site

## Objective

- Scrap the data and display the data into table view
- This will allow support team/tester to have high-level view on the data returns
